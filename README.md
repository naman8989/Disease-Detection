# Disease-Detection
Disease detection software is crucial for early identification of health issues, enabling timely intervention and improving treatment outcomes. It plays a vital role in public health surveillance, providing valuable insights into disease patterns and facilitating data-driven decision-making. Automated systems enhance efficiency by processing large datasets quickly, contributing to global health security and personalized medicine. These tools are instrumental in reducing healthcare costs, as early detection minimizes the need for expensive treatments. Additionally, disease detection software supports remote monitoring, expanding healthcare access. While powerful, ethical considerations and collaboration with healthcare professionals are essential for effective implementation.


So i made a API on Django and publish on Pythonanywhere.com the main advantange of this is that it is tranined on latest data present on Diabetes and Lung Cancer. The application can be intergrated on any plateform by using API feature. The data was trained on the model of Naive Bayes and logistic regression and the best result are give to the use. The application is present for 3 month free on this plateform (pythonanywhere.com) after that link would be removed.
